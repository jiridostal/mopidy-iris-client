# Mopidy Iris Client
<i>Mopidy Iris Client is an Android application that helps users to use Iris on their mobile devices. </i>
<p>This software is an open-source project built on top of <a href="https://github.com/jaedb/Iris">Iris</a> by <a href="http://jamesbarnsley.co.nz">James Barnsley</a>. It's basically a wrapper around web interface that allows to use and manage Iris instance through a mobile application.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this software is to make use of Iris more practical on mobile devices - mainly because it's not very to comfortable to enter "ip:port" like URL in a web browser everytime you want to change a song. With this app you can access Iris with only one tap.
<p><i>Please note that this software in a rare development phase and is not available in Google Play yet.</i></p>
